Instructions to Build and Run

Go to the GitHub repo and download all all the source code. This can be done by hitting the green "code" button and downloading it as a zip file.

Download and install Unity if you don't already have it on your machine (https://unity.com/). Make sure to install Unity version 2019.4.1f1 because that's the version this app will run on. Also, install build support for whatever operating system you're using. Open the project with Unity.

Go to Vuforia's developer website (https://developer.vuforia.com/), make an account, and download the version Vuforia 9. This should be downloaded into the open project.

In Unity, click Window in the task bar and go to Vuforia configuration. Make sure the "max simultaneous tracked fields are set to at least 5 to handle all the widgets. If there isn't an App License Key already provided, set one up at Vuforia's website at enter it into the box.

Print out these image targets. The last one isn't used in this app.

The app can either be run through Unity or it can be built. To build it go to File and click on Build Settings. Select the target platform you want and click Build. This will build the project into an application you can run.

Run the app. Use a camera/webcam on your device and point them at the image targets to see the widgets.
